# Worldcup Database
This is one of the required projects to earn freeCodeCamp Relational Database certification.

In this project, we create a Bash script `insert_data.sh` that enters information from World Cup games into PostgreSQL database `worldcup.sql`, 
then query the database for useful statistics using another Bash script `queries.sh`.
